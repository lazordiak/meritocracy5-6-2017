        <p>Welcome to our
        game! This experiment is being conducted at Vassar College.  
		It consists of fifteen rounds of a public goods game, where you will play with three other players to earn money. 
		The study takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  
		Participation poses minimal risk, meaning the risk is no greater than that of normal, everyday activities.  
		Your anonymous data, identified only by your Mechanical Turk worker ID, will be used for research purposes. 
		You will have the opportunity to earn money while participating, up to a maximum of $7.88. 
		You are free to stop the experiment by closing your browser window at any time.   
		If you have any questions, you can contact Schuyler deVos at scdevos@vassar.edu, or Prof. Jan Andrews at andrewsj@vassar.edu.</p>

        <p>By clicking "Done," you affirm that you are at least 18 years of age, which is the minimum age to participate in this study.</p>
